= ODM m1 PCB

This is the PCB prototype created with KiCAD.
Please note that this is all work-in-progress.
The PCB is not yet tested. The 100R resistors
at the RS485 TX outputs mentioned in the spec
are missing. It still uses mono jacks which might
work for prototyping but do not comply to
EMC rules because of the missing shield.
Very likely there are other mistakes.
