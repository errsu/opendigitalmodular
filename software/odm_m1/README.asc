= ODM m1 software

This is the software (more precisely, firmware)
used so far to test the ODM m1 prototypes.
Please note that this is all work-in-progress.

The code contains a few files from STMicroelectronics
STM32CubeF4, implementing the link:https://developer.arm.com/embedded/cmsis[CMSIS]
API for the STM32F4 processor.
This way the code is self-contained, no external libraries
required, except the C standard libs that come with the compiler.

The software, especially main.c, contains quite a mix
of application, infrastructure and test code that needs
to be separated and put into a more modular form,
so that parts of it like the diagnostics and the DSP code
might be plugged in for different test cases and module instances.
This is just a commit of what is there at the moment.
Once the main.c code is cleaned up, it'll make sense to create
a description of the code and how it is tested.

But before, something needs to be done about building the code.
It was developed using the
link:http://www.openstm32.org/HomePage[System Workbench for STM32],
with a lot of time spent fiddling about the tools setup.
Anyone who worked with these eclipse-based tools
knows how difficult that might be at times, although the tools
themselves are totally OK to use. The goal would be
to have a reproducible set of instructions and/or configuration
files that would allow other people and my future self to build,
run and debug the code. Any ideas about how to achieve this in an
uncomplicated and reliable form would be highly appreciated.
