Open Digital Modular (ODM): Proposal for a Synthesizer Architecture
===================================================================

## What is it?

ODM is an architectural idea that is to be turned into a specification and
a prototype implementation. All this is work in progress. The details can
be found in the [ODM specification document](documentation/ODMSpecification.asc).

## License

See the [licenses page](LICENSES.asc) for details.

## Questions and comments

The main goal of making this public is to get in contact with people for review,
comments, proposals, criticism or laughter. Most valued would be cooperation, and
there is some hope that in the not-so-far future somebody might want to build
actual synthesizers this way.

So, please use the [issue page](https://github.com/errsu/opendigitalmodular/issues)
for public communication or send me a mail for a private conversation.
